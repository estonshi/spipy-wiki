**spipy** is a python package designed for XFEL single particle 
imaging (SPI) analysis and reconstruction.

Nowadays, XFEL (X-ray free electron laser) is becoming a powerful 
method to detect inner structures of micro objects. 
More and more countries are building XFEL facilities for global use:

1. LCLS , U.S.A., from 2009
2. SACLA, Japan, from 2012
3. PAL XFEL, South Korea, from 2016
4. European XFEL, Europe, from 2018
5. SXFEL, China, to be lanched in 2020s
6. ...

There are multiple kinds of imaging for XFEL, such as SFX, WAXS, SPI, etc.
Our group focus on single particle imaging using biological samples such as virus and proteins.
In the meanwhile, other materials like inorganic compounds are also suitable for this experiment.

**spipy** is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/LiuLab-CSRC/spipy) and [Gitee](https://gitee.com/eston/spipy),
maintained by `ycshi` from Tsinghua University and Beijing Computational Science Research Center.
